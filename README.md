# Millennium_Falcon_Space_Apps_team
WHEN LIGHT CURVES THROW US CURVE BALLS

## How to use

`Millennium_Falcon_Space_Apps_team.exe <Path to .obj file> -c=<light factor> -l=<light vector> -r=<axis of rotation> -o=<output plot file .png>`

P.S. light vector and axis of rotation are vectors and we need to set them by 3 float numbers divided by comma, without spaces. Example: `-l=0.0,1.0,0.0`
### All flags have default values
`-c=1.0`

`-l=0.0,1.0,0.0`

`-r=0.0,0.0,1.0`

`-o=<Path to input .obj file, but .obj is replaces by .png>`

And we can launch program without flags: `Millennium_Falcon_Space_Apps_team.exe <Path to .obj file>`
